								<h3>About me</h3>
								<p>My name is Joshua Christopher Dyson Sykes. I come from a mostly British background, with my whole father’s side being English, and on my mother’s side her mother is English, and father was Italian. I my self are English, born and lived there for 3 years until I migrated here to Australia. Culture wise, I can say that I am fully English, however having an Australian citizenship classifies my partly Australian, though I love to keep to my English roots. I finished year 12 last year and currently in my first year here at RMIT and loving it. I can only speak English, but next semester starting to learn Spanish. I love to travel and with the help of speaking another language will assist me in finding jobs overseas in new and exciting countries.</p>

								<h4>My interest in IT</h4>
								<p>My main interest in IT started around the time I got my first DS. That was the first experience of using an IT based system. And from then on, I got addicted to everything thing about IT. I gradually got interested in PC’s in primary school where we had a computer lab full of desktops. I recall messing around with them trying to bypass the sites blocked (Games website), so that me and my friends could play them during computer lap sessions. Ever since then, I have helped around the house with anything needing fixing or helping which involves IT. TV’s, laptops, phones and WIFI. Anything that needed fixing I fixed. </p>

								<p>My reasons for coming to RMIT was mainly based on the campus and open day. When I first pondered about going to university in general I first had to decide what course I wanted to do. From the get go, I was already interested in IT and telecommunications, so I decided to choose a course which best suited those needs. I was contemplating between RMIT and Swinburne. However, RMIT has a course (Bachelor of Technology – Computing Studies), which provided the IT interests that I had and the flexibility and a wider selection of elective studies.  I also had some recommendations from friends and family saying that it was a good choice. </p>
								
								<p>The main outcomes of what I want to gain from my course, would be the ability to apply my knowledge in telecommunication style jobs. I would expect to come out with the foundation and knowledge which would allow me to further my career in the telecommunications industry and finding a long-term jobs which would provide me with the stability for the long run.</p>
